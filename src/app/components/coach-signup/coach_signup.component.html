                    <b>The Complete 90</b> (collectively, the “Provider”, “We”, “Our” and “Us”) is committed to improving soccer skills through the Site by providing an online service (the “Service”) by which You may access individual and group personal training, goalkeeper training, soccer camps, and an online library of training session videos to improve your soccer skills, which for the most part requires You to purchase a membership subscription.<br>
                    <br>
                    As used herein, the term “You” refers to you, the user and/or subscriber of the Site, if you are 18 years of age or older, or, as applicable, your child on whose behalf you agree to these Terms of Use. The effective date of this Agreement is when You accept this Agreement in accordance with the procedure set forth above.<br>

In no event shall the Provider or any individual or company involved with the Provider be liable for special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages of any nature, including but not limited to personal injury arising from the Service.
