            <p>Our goal is to create an environment and session where you can improve upon all aspects of your game. THE<b>COMPLETE 90</b>’s 1 hour session will be broken down into drills focused highly on technique which will then be implemented into higher intensity drills focused on repetition at speed. The remaining time will be spent working on agility/ strength or any other aspect of the game you would like.<br>  
            <br>
            Find the coach that is the best fit for you and your position and allow The Complete 90 to mold you into a complete player! On the other hand, if 1 on 1 sessions are a bit out of your price range then maybe a group session will work best for you.<br>

        <div class="col-lg-10 sessionDesc">
            <p>When teammates start seeing your improvements in training and want the same results, make sure to bring them out for a group session. Small group sessions are great in the sense that you will still get plenty of touches on the ball with your coach, as well as giving everybody the attention needed. Furthermore, our coaches will be able to create game-like drills that will better your understanding of finding solutions in certain scenarios.<br>  
            <br>
            If you are a coach of a club team and are unable to make a session or just feel like staying home and taking the day off then give THE<b>COMPLETE 90</b> a call and we will take over for the night. If there is a team focus for the night then we will stick with it, otherwise we can create a program just for the one session or for multiple sessions.<br>
