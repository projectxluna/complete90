					<h3>FOUNDER - The Complete 90</h3>
					<p>My College career started off at the University of Montevallo. During my two years there I was named the rookie of the year, won a conference championship, lead the team with assists, and eventually was offered the choice to transfer to Boston College. This gave me the exposure to professional teams that I was looking for. After my fist year at Boston College I lead the team with goals and was named as the Captain for the upcoming season. I was honoured to lead my team onto the pitch and was sad for it to come to an end when I was drafted to the Seattle Sounders FC at seasons end.<br> 
					<br>
	   				The Seattle Sounders FC marked the beginning of my professional career. My level of play increased at an incredible speed as expected when training with the likes of Clint Dempsey and Obafemi Martins. I continued my success and was rewarded with my proudest moment to date- representing Canada by being a part of the U-23 Mens National team at the 2016 Rio Olympic Qualifications. I played with the best Canadian players in the country and was coached by a previous Real Madrid Manager, Benito Flores. I learned more from Benito Flores in the 3 weeks with the National team then I had anywhere else.<br>
	   				<br>
	   				My National team call up created a buzz that landed me a contract with the Canadian squad, The Vancouver Whitecaps FC. I was living in a dream city doing what I loved. Unfortunately I couldnâ€™t come to terms to stay another season. Therefore I am currently playing with Sigma FC in League 1 Ontario preparing myself for what is to come next.</p>
